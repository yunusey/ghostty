# This file documents the subsystem maintainers of the Ghostty project
# along with the responsibilities of a maintainer and how one can become
# a maintainer.
#
# Ghostty follows a subsystem maintainer model where distinguished
# contributors (with mutual agreement) are designated as maintainers of a
# specific subset of the project. A subsystem maintainer has more privileges
# and authority over a specific part of the project than a regular
# contributor and deference is given to them when making decisions about
# their subsystem.
#
# Ultimately Ghostty has a BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) model
# currently with @mitchellh as the BDFL. The BDFL has the final say in all
# decisions and may override a maintainer's decision if necessary. I like to
# say its a BDFLFN (Benevolent Dictator For Life "For Now") model because
# long term I'd like to see the project be more community driven. But for
# now, early in its life, we're going with this model.
#
# ## Privileges
#
#   - Authority to approve or reject pull requests in their subsystem.
#   - Authority to moderate issues and discussions in their subsystem.
#   - Authority to make roadmap and design decisions about their subsystem
#     with input only from other subsystem maintainers.
#
# In all scenarios, the BDFL doesn't need to be consulted for decisions
# but may revert or override decisions if necessary. The expectation is
# that maintainers will be trusted to make the right decisions for their
# subsystem and this will be rare.
#
# ## Responsibilities
#
# Subsystem maintainership is a voluntary role and maintainers are not
# expected to dedicate any amount of time to the project. However, if a
# maintainer is inactive for a long period of time, they may be removed from
# the maintainers list to avoid bitrot or outdated information.
#
# Maintainers are expected to be exemplary members of the community and
# should be respectful, helpful, and professional in all interactions.
# This is both in regards to the community at large as well as other
# subsystem maintainers as well as @mitchellh.
#
# As technical leaders, maintainers are expected to be mindful about
# breaking changes, performance, user impact, and other technical
# considerations in their subsystem. They should be considerate of large
# changes and should be able to justify their decisions.
#
# Notably, maintainers have NO OBLIGATION to review pull requests or issues
# in their subsystem. They have full discretion to review or not review
# anything they want. This isn't a job! It is a role of trust and authority
# and the expectation is that maintainers will use their best judgement.
#
# ## Becoming a Maintainer
#
# Maintainer candidates are noticed and proposed by the community. Anyone
# may propose themselves or someone else as a maintainer. The BDFL along
# with existing maintainers will discuss and decide.
#
# Generally, we want to see consistent high quality contributions to a
# specific subsystem before considering someone as a maintainer. There isn't
# an exact number of contributions or time period required but generally
# we're looking for an order of a dozen or more contributions over a period of
# months, at least.
#
# # Subsystem List
#
# The subsystems don't fully cover the entirety of the Ghostty project but
# are created organically as experts in certain areas emerge. If you feel
# you are an expert in a certain area and would like to be a maintainer,
# please reach out to @mitchellh on Discord.
#
# (Alphabetical order)
#
# - @ghostty-org/font - All things font related including discovery,
#   rasterization, shaping, coloring, etc.
#
# - @ghostty-org/gtk - Anything GTK-related in the project, primarily
#   the GTK apprt. Also includes X11/Wayland integrations and general
#   Linux support.
#
# - @ghostty-org/localization/* - Anything related to localization
#   for a specific locale.
#
# - @ghosty-org/localization/manager - Manage all localization tasks
#   and tooling. They are not responsible for any specific locale but
#   are responsible for the overall localization process and tooling.
#
# - @ghostty-org/macos - The Ghostty macOS app and any macOS-specific
#   features, configurations, etc.
#
# - @ghostty-org/packaging/snap - Ghostty snap packaging
#   (https://snapcraft.io/ghostty)
#
# - @ghostty-org/renderer - Ghostty rendering subsystem, including the
#   rendering abstractions as well as specific renderers like OpenGL
#   and Metal.
#
# - @ghostty-org/shell - Ghostty shell integration, including shell
#   completions, shell detection, and any other shell interactions.
#
# - @ghostty-org/terminal - The terminal emulator subsystem, including
#   subprocess management and pty handling, escape sequence parsing,
#   key encoding, etc.
#
# ## Outside of Ghostty
#
# Other "subsystems" exist outside of Ghostty and will not be represented
# in this CODEOWNERS file:
#
# - @ghostty-org/discord-bot - Maintainers of the Ghostty Discord bot.
#
# - @ghostty-org/website - Maintainers of the Ghostty website.
