//! Surface represents a single terminal "surface". A terminal surface is
//! a minimal "widget" where the terminal is drawn and responds to events
//! such as keyboard and mouse. Each surface also creates and owns its pty
//! session.
//!
//! The word "surface" is used because it is left to the higher level
//! application runtime to determine if the surface is a window, a tab,
//! a split, a preview pane in a larger window, etc. This struct doesn't care:
//! it just draws and responds to events. The events come from the application
//! runtime so the runtime can determine when and how those are delivered
//! (i.e. with focus, without focus, and so on).
